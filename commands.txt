#git add .
#git status      //to see all the files which are in staging area
#git reset commands.txt        //to unstage a file

making changes to git file from github and have already added and commited some content form git now trying to push the commit from git to github it will ask to first pull the changes from github to git then push the changes from git to github. but while pulling merge conflict will occur. (commiting the changes from github)
#git pull origin master        //pull changes from github
resolved merge conflict
commit the changes
#git add .
#git commit -m "merged with github"
push the code to github
#git push origin master

adding new branch
#git branch         //to view all the branches
#git branch puneet   //add new branch
#git checkout puneet  //to use this new branch
#git add .
#git commit -m "created new branch"
#git push origin puneet   //pushing changes to puneet branch  ..changed this line after pushing the code

compare what changes have been done in local after pushing the code to github
#git diff puneet origin/puneet
